# Biomedical Literature RAG Assistant

**Tech Stack:** Llama 3, ChromaDB, HuggingFace

## Features
- Architected a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Llama 3 and HuggingFace embeddings to extract and synthesize targeted biomedical data from thousands of unstructured medical research papers and clinical journals.
- Implemented semantic chunking and ChromaDB vector embeddings to clean messy real-world PDF data, developing a robust codebase to translate complex clinical terminology into structured, highly accurate textual summaries.
- Conducted rigorous benchmarking by comparing generated answers against a gold-standard human review dataset, calculating baseline concordance metrics to minimize model hallucination.
